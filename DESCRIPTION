Description: In bulk epigenome/transcriptome experiments, molecular expression
    is measured in a tissue, which is a mixture of multiple types of cells.
    This package tests association of a disease/phenotype with a molecular marker
    for each cell type.
    The proportion of cell types in each sample needs to be given as input.
    The package is applicable to epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of
    microarray experiments.
